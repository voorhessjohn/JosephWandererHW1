None of the adorable puppies that I've encountered in my charmed life could ever hope to match the luxuriousness of one classy lady.

Well maybe "classy" isn't quite the right word. Special. That lady was special.

I remember how during Canadian Thanksgiving, the drunkest of occasions, that special lady taught me how to squaredance while knitting without making it seem too pretentious.

Not intentionally, of course, but verbally nonetheless.

There was a contest being held at the old mill for all the cheese the children had found in the forest since tuesday. 

All I needed to do was boogie. Boogie like my rainbow was on the line, because it was. 

My cheeks felt like daffodils and my nose itched appropriately. 

But then I saw that very special, not quite classy lady kick, and I felt inspired.

The noble folk of that humble hamlet will forevermore 
tell tales of the wizardry that can appear when a special lady will kick and someone like me will, in response, commence to boogie for the ages.
